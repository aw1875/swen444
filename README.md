# SWEN444 Practice Web App

This project was created in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with combination with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## How to run this project

Start by cloning the repo to your desired location using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aw1875/swen444.git
```

## Install Dependencies

Make sure you are in the project directory:
```bash
cd swen444
```

Then run `npm i` to install all required dependencies.

## Run the project

Once the required dependencies have installed you can very easily start the project with:
```bash
npm start
```
This command should automatically open the project in a new tab of your web browser. However, if it doesn't for some reason then all you need to do is open a new tab and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the project manually.
